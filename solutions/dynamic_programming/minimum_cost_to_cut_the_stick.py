    Minimum Cost to Cut the Stick

    Problem Description:
    Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labeled from `0` to `n`.
    You are also given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position
    where you have to cut the stick.

    Cutting a stick of length `L` costs `L`. The cut creates two smaller sticks.
    This process is repeated until all cuts are made. The order of cuts can be chosen
    to minimize the total cost.

    The problem asks to find the minimum total cost to make all the cuts.

    Example:
    n = 7, cuts = [1, 5, 2]
    Initial stick is [0, 7].
    Possible cuts are at 1, 2, 5.
    
    If we cut at 2 first:
    Cost = 7. Two sticks: [0, 2] and [2, 7].
    For [0, 2], remaining cut is 1. Cost = 2. Sticks: [0, 1], [1, 2].
    For [2, 7], remaining cut is 5. Cost = 5. Sticks: [2, 5], [5, 7].
    Total cost = 7 + 2 + 5 = 14.

    If we cut at 1 first:
    Cost = 7. Two sticks: [0, 1] and [1, 7].
    For [0, 1], no more cuts.
    For [1, 7], remaining cuts are 2, 5.
        If we cut at 2: Cost = 6. Sticks: [1, 2], [2, 7].
        For [2, 7], cut is 5. Cost = 5. Sticks: [2, 5], [5, 7].
        Total cost = 7 + 6 + 5 = 18. (This is worse)

    The optimal strategy involves using dynamic programming on intervals.
    First, sort the `cuts` array and add `0` and `n` to it to represent the ends of the stick.
    Let this new array be `c` of length `m`.
    `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to cut the stick from `c[i]` to `c[j]`.
    The length of this stick segment is `c[j] - c[i]`.
    To make this cut, we must choose an intermediate cut point `c[k]` where `i < k < j`.
    The cost for `dp[i][j]` will be `(c[j] - c[i]) + dp[i][k] + dp[k][j]`.
    We need to find the minimum among all possible `k`.
    Base case: `dp[i][i+1] = 0` (no cuts needed for a segment between two consecutive points).

    Args:
        stick_length (int): The total length of the wooden stick.
        cut_positions (list[int]): A list of positions where cuts need to be made.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum total cost to make all cuts.
