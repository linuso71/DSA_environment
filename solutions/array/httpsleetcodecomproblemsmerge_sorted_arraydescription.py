    https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/
    You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

    Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

    The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

    Example 1:
    Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
    Output: [1,2,3,0,0,0] -> [1,2,2,3,5,6] (after modifying nums1)
    Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
    The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6].
    Note that the output is not returned by the function.

    Example 2:
    Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
    The result of the merge is [1].

    Example 3:
    Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
    The result of the merge is [1].

    Constraints:
    `nums1.length == m + n`
    `nums2.length == n`
    `0 <= m, n <= 200`
    `1 <= m + n <= 200`
    `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9`

    Merges two sorted integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, into `nums1` in non-decreasing order.
    The first `m` elements of `nums1` are the actual elements to be merged, and the last `n` elements are `0` placeholders.
    The function modifies `nums1` in-place and does not return anything.

    Args:
        nums1 (List[int]): The first sorted array, which has a length of `m + n`.
                           The first `m` elements are to be merged, and the last `n` are placeholders (usually 0s).
        m (int): The number of actual elements in `nums1` to be merged.
        nums2 (List[int]): The second sorted array, with a length of `n`.
        n (int): The number of elements in `nums2`.
